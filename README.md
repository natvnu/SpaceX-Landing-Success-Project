# SpaceX-Landing-Success-Project
Determining if first stage of Falcon9 will successfully land

## Project background and context:

In the modern space race, companies are utilizing cost efficiency through reusability. 
SpaceX dominates the launch market with Falcon 9 at $62M per launch—60% cheaper than competitors ($165M+). Their advantage are reusable first-stage boosters.

For comapny Space Y to compete, predicting SpaceX’s reuse decision is critical. By analyzing public launch data and training machine learning models, Space Y can forecast SpaceX’s costs and strategically price its own services.

Question Space Y wants to answer:
### Will SpaceX be able to successfully land the first stage of its rocket during its next launch?
